# EventBooking
MKT &amp; SKT automation. Being in two tourist organizations exposes me to the problem of manual event booking. The event organizer 
has to keep track of incoming participants and a lot of communication is done for simple first come first serve scenarios. This is an attempt on the process automation, where participants will be able to book events with a few clicks and the booking order will be automatic.
